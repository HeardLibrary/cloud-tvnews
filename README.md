# Cloud TV News
The goal of this project is to build a data pipeline for the Vanderbilt Television News Archive to replace the existing perl-based system. The data pipeline runs on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) using the [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/). The code is primarily written in Python and configuration files are primarily JSON.
